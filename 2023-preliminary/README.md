The prototype of the tool (version 0.6) has been evaluated
in the spring of 2023 with by five professional developers
having between four and fifteen years of experience each. 
They were presented with the tool in a workshop, then invited to
choose a project and define view specifications for it, as well
as integrate it into their GitHub workflow. 
After letting them use Architectural Lens as they saw fit for a week we asked
them to fill in a questionnaire. 
The answers to the questionnaire are found in [InterviewTranscripts.pdf](InterviewTranscripts.pdf)
